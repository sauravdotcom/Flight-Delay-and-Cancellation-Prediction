# Flight-Delay-and-Cancellation-Prediction
Flight delay and cancellation prediction is an important task for airlines and passengers alike. Delayed or cancelled flights can lead to a lot of inconvenience and frustration for travelers, and can also result in significant losses for airlines.

To predict flight delays and cancellations, a number of factors must be taken into account, including weather conditions, airport congestion, mechanical problems, and more. This requires a large amount of data to be collected and analyzed, which is where data preprocessing using Spark comes in.

Spark is a powerful open-source distributed computing framework that can handle large amounts of data efficiently. By using Spark, data can be processed and cleaned quickly and efficiently, which is crucial for flight delay and cancellation prediction.

Spark SQL can also be used to perform queries on the data, allowing analysts to easily filter and aggregate the data as needed. This can be helpful for identifying patterns and trends in the data that can be used to predict flight delays and cancellations.

Once the data has been preprocessed and analyzed, machine learning algorithms can be used to create models that can predict flight delays and cancellations. The MLlib library in Spark provides a wide range of algorithms that can be used for this purpose, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

Overall, the combination of data preprocessing using Spark, Spark SQL for querying the data, and MLlib for model building makes flight delay and cancellation prediction a powerful tool for airlines and passengers alike. By accurately predicting flight delays and cancellations, airlines can take proactive steps to minimize disruptions, while passengers can better plan their travel arrangements and avoid unnecessary inconvenience.
